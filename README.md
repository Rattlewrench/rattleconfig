# rattleconfig
My Team Fortress 2 config.
Designed to use in conjuction with [mastercomfig](https://github.com/mastercoms/mastercomfig) (v6.11.0 and up).

`/user/` folder is supposed to be put into the `~/tf/cfg/` folder;
While masterconfig's `.vpk` file should be located in the `~/tf/custom`.

Don't forget to add following to the TF2's Launch Options:

`-novid -nojoy -nosteamcontroller -softparticlesdefaultoff -reuse -nostartupsound -refresh 119.98 -console -dxlevel 92 -gl_enablesamplerobjects`
